# PHP-website
Not a sweet looking website :( but idea was to code some PHP backend

A summer course I took last summer to get in web development. A pure PHP backend. Some javascript used in frontend.

Requirements can be found in a pdf file. Currently they are in finnish now. Every requirement is fulfilled. 

Tested with WAMP-server and had to update MYSQL_ASSOC to MYSQLI_ASSOC


Things I learned : 

- Sign in and creating users with PHP and SQL. Only experience before is creating same things with C#

- Lots of php commands, more sql experience.

- Sessions. I saved user as a session for sign out. Plus you cannot inspect websites futher than sign in screen if you dont have session created which in this case means verified sign in. I Coul've used also some cookies but didnt feel as comfortable with them.


Things to add/develop : 

- Preventing SQL injection attacks as well as XSS (Cross site scripting). Very important part of web development.

- Better user experience

- More visual work in frontend side :)
