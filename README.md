# PHP-website
Not a sweet looking website :( but idea was to code some PHP backend

A summer course I took last summer to get in web development. A pure PHP backend. Some javascript used in frontend.

Requirements can be found in a pdf file. Currently they are in finnish now. Every requirement is filled.
